# sentanalysis-book-chinese

- currently analyzing the book (投资中不简单的事](https://book.douban.com/subject/27622006/)

# usage

- python 3.6.9

- install ```nltk tqdm snownlp matplotlib jieba wordcloud icecream```

- ```python main.py``` for basic analysis

- ```python sent.py``` for sentiment histogram by sentence

# note 

- ```tz.txt``` can be any chinese book really

# todo 

- observing we can swap ```tz.txt``` for anything, perhaps we can streamline the process to analyze books in that fashion, working with libraries like [this libgen downloader](https://github.com/mmarquezs/libgen-python-api)

- perhaps use more sophisticated models like bert and such.

# cheers
